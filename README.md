# Ogame-Cairo

_Ogame logic implementation written in Cairo for Starknet._

## What is ogame

OGame is a browser-based, money-management and space-war themed massively multiplayer online browser game with over two million accounts. OGame was created in 2002 and is produced and maintained by Gameforge. Players can have multiple planet, a fleet and attack each other to steal resources.

## Roadmap

1. Account can create a planet and upgrade mines. Only mines are available. :heavy_check_mark:
2. Integration of ERC721: planets will be NFTs.
3. Integration of ERC20: resources will be tokenized.
4. Add energy production requirements for mines.
5. Add time constraints for buildings upgrades.
6. Implementation of basic facilities:
   - Shipyard
   - Robot Factory
7. Implementation of basic ships:
   - Small Cargo
   - Light Fighter

This will most likely keep me busy for a while. The rest of the roadmap is yet to be decided.
